New features with AN-2022-10-XX:

With great sadness we report the death of schilytools main author and
long time maintainer Jörg Schilling (1955-03-27--2021-10-10).  Jörg, we
miss you!  After his passing, development has been picked up by a group
of volunteers who would like to keep the project alive and well.  Our
goal is to carefully preserve the portability and compatibility of this
project while extending it to new platforms and implementing new tools
and features that fit the tool set.

As a part of the change in management, the schilytools project has moved
from Sourceforge to Codeberg.  Please report bugs and send patches to
our bug tracker:

	https://codeberg.org/schilytools/schilytools

or to our mailing list schilytools@mlists.in-berlin.de:

	https://mlists.in-berlin.de/mailman/listinfo/schilytools-mlists.in-berlin.de

If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

UPDATING:

-	man2html: The man2html utility has been removed from the
	schilytools distribution.  Users who wish to continue using this
	utility are advised to use Thomas Dickey's version instead.

		https://dickey.his.com/scripts/man2html.html

-	Various man pages have been renamed to follow BSD conventions.
	Users may need to manually remove the following old man pages on
	update: streamarchive.4, makefiles.4, makerules.4, changeset.4,
	sccschangeset.4, sccsfile.4, and star.4.

NEW FEATURES:

-	libfind/sfind: Fix incorrect error handling of -exec ... {} +
	primaries.  Previously in some cases the primary returned an
	error even though it should always return true and in other
	cases it completely disregarded the exit code.  Now the primary
	always returns true and sets the exit code of libfind and sfind
	to a non-zero value in case one of the commands returned with a
	non-zero exit code.
	Reported by Tavian Barnes.  Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	libfind/sfind: Report failures to query the password/group
	database for -nouser/-nogroup.  Previously failure to query
	these databases was treated as if the user id/group id was not
	found.  We now print a diagnostic message and return a non-zero
	value if the getpwuid() or getgrgid() call failed.
	Reported by Tavian Barnes.

-	libfind/sfind: Report presence of directory loops.  Previously,
	such directory loops were silently ignored.  Now, upon
	encountering a directory loop, sfind prints a diagnostic message
	to standard error.  The search is continued but sfind will
	terminate with a nonzero exit status.  This change improves
	compatibility with POSIX (cf. PASC interpretation request 1606).
	All libfind consumers calling the treewalk() function (mkisofs,
	sccs, and star) are affected.
	Reported by Tavian Barnes.  Submitted by Nico Sonack.

-	star: rename tests/compress archives to avoid issues on case
	insensitive file systems.  These file systems do not like having
	multiple files whose names only differ in letter case.  Rename
	the archives to completely distinct file names to avoid this
	issue.
	Reported by tux <rosa.elefant@icloud.com>.

-	mkisofs/mkisofs.8: adjust reference of magic(4) to magic(5)
	Submitted by Martin Rehak.

-	*: With the switch of Solaris from SysV man page sections to BSD
	man page sections, man pages are now installed according to BSD
	conventions instead of SysV conventions.  This affects the man
	pages makefiles(4), makerules(4), streamarchive(4),
	changeset(4), sccsfile(4), sccschangeset(4), and star(4).
	Reported by Friedhelm Mehnert.

-	*: All references to Solaris man pages have been adjusted to BSD
	man page sections as used in Solaris 11.4.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	RULES: symbol versioning will be enabled for FreeBSD after
	sufficient testing.
